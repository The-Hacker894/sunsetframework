# sunsetframework
Sunset Discord Bot framework is a small NodeJS application that you can download and build off of for your own personal use **as long as you give me credit** ;)  

## Prerequisites
[x] Make sure you have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) installed
[x] Have the NPM packages installed *(all of the packages Sunset uses are in the `package.json`)*
[x] Get a process manager like [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2)
[x] Get a programming text editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
[x] Put your bot token in the `data.json` 

## How to Start
1. Download the master zip and unzip the file
2. Open Terminal (macOS & Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)
3. Type `npm index.js` or `pm2 start index.js --name "SunsetFrameWork"` and press enter
4. You now have the Sunset Framework up and running
